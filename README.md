# MIDI-Note-Analizer

This is a little test program that I'm using to learn more about python and data analysis.

Functions as of now:

- Take midi file and output note counts per track
- Plot said notes on a stack bar plot with multiple labeled tracks

TO-DO:

- Real time animation of the note count plot while the midi file plays
- Chord detection
- Plotting the scales on the background
- Detecting key and scales, and hopefully more things
- Track manager to select which tracks get plotted
- Identify percussion tracks and ignore(I have little idea about percussion)
